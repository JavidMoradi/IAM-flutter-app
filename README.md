# Identity and Access Management Flutter App
This is an IAM flutter application mockup of my <a href='https://github.com/JavidMoradi/CS399-Summer-Training'>internship</a>'s front-end; please refer to the repository for functioanlity of the project, as this project serves the same functionality, and uses that repository's back-end.

In brief, after a user logged in, an JSON Web Token is provided to user, and it is a mandatory requirement for each operation's header section. Later, All the methods available are presented. If the user has a credit to access a method, success alert will be give; otherwise, error alert will be given.

Please refer to <a href='https://github.com/JavidMoradi/IAM-flutter-app/tree/main/ui'>here</a> for UI section of the project.
